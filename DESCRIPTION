Title: Additional functions for working with ChIP-Seq data
Authors@R: person("Stephen", "Pederson", 
  email = "stephen.pederson.au@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package builds on existing tools and adds some simple but
   extremely useful capabilities for working with ChIP-Seq data. The focus is 
   on detecting differential binding windows/regions. However, it's still in 
   the very early stages of development.
