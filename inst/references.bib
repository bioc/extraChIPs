              normalization procedure, has been successful. These plots, while
              originally devised for gene expression data from microarrays, can
              also be used to reveal unwanted variation in many other kinds of
              high dimensional data, where such variation can be problematic.",

              differential expression of genes in microarray experiments. The
              most widely used methods successfully test whether the true
              differential expression is different from zero, but give no
              assurance that the differences found are large enough to be
              biologically meaningful. RESULTS: We present a method, t-tests
              relative to a threshold (TREAT), that allows researchers to test
              formally the hypothesis (with associated p-values) that the
              differential expression in a microarray experiment is greater
              than a given (biologically meaningful) threshold. We have
              evaluated the method using simulated data, a dataset from a
              quality control experiment for microarrays and data from a
              biological experiment investigating histone deacetylase
              inhibitors. When the magnitude of differential expression is
              taken into account, TREAT improves upon the false discovery rate
              of existing methods and identifies more biologically relevant
              genes. AVAILABILITY: R code implementing our methods is

  author   = "Wilson, Daniel J",
  abstract = "Analysis of ``big data'' frequently involves statistical
              comparison of millions of competing hypotheses to discover hidden
              processes underlying observed patterns of data, for example, in
              the search for genetic determinants of disease in genome-wide
              association studies (GWAS). Controlling the familywise error rate
              (FWER) is considered the strongest protection against false
              positives but makes it difficult to reach the multiple
              testing-corrected significance threshold. Here, I introduce the
              harmonic mean p-value (HMP), which controls the FWER while
              greatly improving statistical power by combining dependent tests
              using generalized central limit theorem. I show that the HMP
              effortlessly combines information to detect statistically
              significant signals among groups of individually nonsignificant
              hypotheses in examples of a human GWAS for neuroticism and a
              joint human-pathogen GWAS for hepatitis C viral load. The HMP
              simultaneously tests all ways to group hypotheses, allowing the
              smallest groups of hypotheses that retain significance to be
              sought. The power of the HMP to detect significant hypothesis
              groups is greater than the power of the Benjamini-Hochberg
              procedure to detect significant hypotheses, although the latter
              only controls the weaker false discovery rate (FDR). The HMP has
              broad implications for the analysis of large datasets, because it
              enhances the potential for scientific discovery.",
