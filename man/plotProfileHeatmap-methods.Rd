\arguments{
\item{object}{A GRanges or GRangesList object}

\item{...}{Passed to \link[ggplot2]{facet_grid} internally. Can be utilised
for switching panel strips or passing a labeller function}

\item{profileCol}{Column name specifying where to find the profile DataFrames}

\item{xValue, fillValue}{Columns within the profile DataFrames for heatmaps}

\item{facetX, facetY}{Column used for facetting across the x- or y-axis
respectively}

\item{colour}{Column used for colouring lines in the summary panel. Defaults
to any column used for facetY}

\item{linetype}{Column used for linetypes in the summary panel}

\item{summariseBy}{Function for creating the summary plot in the top panel.
If set to 'none', no summary plot will be drawn. Otherwise the top panel will
contain a line-plot representing this summary value for each x-axis bin}

\item{xLab, yLab, fillLab}{Labels for plotting aesthetics. Can be overwritten
using labs() on any returned object}

\item{relHeight}{The relative height of the top summary panel.
Represents the fraction of the plotting area taken up by the summary panel.}

\description{
Plot a Coverage Profile Heatmap across multiple ranges
}
\details{
Convenience function for plotting coverage heatmaps across a common set of
ranges, shared between one or more samples. These are most commonly the
coverage values from merged samples within a treatment group. THe input
data structure is based on that obtained from \link{getProfileData}, and can
be provided either as a GRanges object (generally for one sample) or as a
GRangesList.

A 'profile DataFrame' here refers to a data.frame (or tibble, or DataFrame)
with a coverage value in one column that corresponds to a genomic bin of a
fixed size denoted in another, as generated by \link{getProfileData}.
Given that multiple ranges are most likely to be drawn, each profile data
frame must be the same size in terms of the number of bins, each of which
represent a fixed number of nucleotides. At a minimum this is a two column
data frame although getProfileData will provide three columns for each
specified genomic region.

If using a GRangesList, each list element will be drawn as a separate panel
by default. These panels will appear in the same order as the list elements
of the GRangesList, although this can easily be overwritten by passing a
column name to the facetX argument. The default approach will add the
original element names as the column "name" which can be seen in the $data
element of any resultant ggplot object produced by this function.

bw <- system.file("tests", "test.bw", package = "rtracklayer")
gr <- GRanges("chr2:500")
pd <- getProfileData(bw, gr, upstream = 100, bins = 10)
plotProfileHeatmap(pd, "profile_data") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "inferno", direction = -1) +
  labs(fill = "Coverage")

pd$group <- "group1"
