# Introduction

This package is designed to enable the Gene Regulatory Analysis using Variable 
IP ([GRAVI](https://github.com/steveped/GRAVI)) workflow, as a method for
detecting differential binding in ChIP-Seq datasets.
There are essentially four sets of functions provided with this package:

1. Those which manipulate with conventional *GRanges* objects
2. Functions for visualisation of ChIP-Seq and related data
3. Functions for aiding the analysis during the workflow
4. General coercion functions which may be more widely applicable
